## Dataset Visualization
This repository contains visualizations created from a dataset. The visualizations include a histogram, scatter plot, boxplot, and correlation matrix. These visualizations provide insights into the distribution, relationships, and correlations among the variables in the dataset.
### Dataset
The dataset used for the visualizations is stored in the file winequality-red.csv. It consists of several variables, including continuous and categorical variables.

### Visualizations
### Histogram
The histogram visualizes the distribution of a continuous variable in the dataset. It provides insights into the frequency or count of values within different intervals or bins.


### Scatter Plot
 The scatter plot displays the relationship between two continuous variables in the dataset. Each data point represents a combination of values from both variables, allowing us to observe any patterns, trends, or correlations.

###  Boxplot
The boxplot showcases the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories. It provides information about the median, quartiles, and potential outliers within each category.


###  Correlation Matrix
The correlation matrix illustrates the pairwise correlations between all the variables in the dataset. It helps identify the strength and direction of the relationships between variables, ranging from -1 to 1.
